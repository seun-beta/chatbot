## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The **FCMB Chatbot** backend provides real-time banking information (such as account balances, recent transactions) and answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) through APIs powered by **FastAPI**. It integrates with GPT-4 for dynamic, conversational responses and Elasticsearch for FAQ retrieval. The chatbot backend intelligently handles requests by switching between API-based responses for real-time data and FAQ-based answers for static queries.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Follow these instructions to set up the FastAPI chatbot backend locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed:

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL (or any preferred database)
- Elasticsearch (for FAQ retrieval)
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4)

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fcmb-chatbot-backend.git
cd fcmb-chatbot-backend
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the necessary values in the `.env` file, such as:

- PostgreSQL credentials
- Elasticsearch credentials
- OpenAI API key

4. **Run the application**:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now, the backend will be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The backend handles two types of queries:

1. **Real-time Banking Data**: Users can ask:
   - "What is my account balance?"
   - "Show me my recent transactions."

   The chatbot will call the relevant banking API endpoints to fetch real-time data.

2. **FAQ Queries**: Users can ask:
   - "How do I apply for a loan?"
   - "What is the daily transfer limit?"

   The chatbot will retrieve the answer using Elasticsearch and GPT-4.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

### Steps to deploy the FastAPI backend to production:

1. Set up PostgreSQL (or preferred database) and Elasticsearch in the production environment.
2. Configure your OpenAI API key and other necessary environment variables.
3. Deploy the FastAPI app using a production-ready ASGI server like **Uvicorn** or **Gunicorn**.

To start the production server using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app
```

4. Set up NGINX (or similar) as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the FastAPI application.
